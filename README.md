An interesting question that brings all these theorems together.
Calculate C(n,r) (mod m) where m is a squarefree number (squarefree number is product of distinct prime numbers-no repeated primes).
trying it the simple way is not preferred due to huge complexity as n,r,m becomes huge.
so for its solution we need three major theorems.
